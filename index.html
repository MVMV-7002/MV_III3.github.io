	<p style="color:#680b08;font-family:verdana;font-size:200%;">The Toyota Supra is an iconic sports car that has been thrilling driving enthusiasts since its debut in 1978. 
	Known for its powerful engines, sleek design, and exceptional performance, the Supra has earned a legendary status 
	in automotive history. From its humble beginnings as a variant of the Toyota Celica to becoming a global performance icon,
	the Supra has evolved through several generations. The most famous, the fourth generation (A80), gained worldwide recognition
	thanks to its 2JZ-GTE engine and role in "The Fast & Furious" movie franchise. 
	After a long hiatus, Toyota reintroduced the Supra in 2020 (A90), now developed in collaboration with BMW. 
	The modern Supra blends cutting-edge technology and thrilling performance, continuing the Supra's legacy as a favorite among enthusiasts and car lovers.
